# Life-Expectancy-Prediction
Project Python for Data Science VNU-HCMUS 2022-2023
## Introduction
Building a life expectancy prediction model using Python language and Machine Learning.
This is my first Machine Learning project so there are many mistakes.

## Data Description
- The data is from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data
- The data includes 2938 rows, 22 columns

## Steps
1. Read and understand the Data 
2. Data Preprocessing 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis  
4. Model Building 

## Conclusion
By analyzing the data and using the Linear Regression algorithm, the R square coefficient to build the model, we can have some conclusions such as adult mortality, school years, human development index (in terms of the income structure of resources) are the factors that have the most impact on life expectancy. That shows the importance of health, education and economic characteristics on longevity.
In addition, some factors do not have an influence such as national population, GDP... as well as factors that have not been considered such as environmental and geographical characteristics. The inclusion and dependence of these proposed effects on longevity remains a matter of debate and is part of the future of research in this particular area.
